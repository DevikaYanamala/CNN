# 🧠 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on MNIST

This repository contains an implementation of a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** using TensorFlow/Keras to classify handwritten digits from the **MNIST dataset**.

---

## 📊 Project Overview
The MNIST dataset includes **70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0–9)**:
- Training set: 60,000 images  
- Test set: 10,000 images  
- Image size: 28×28 pixels  

The goal is to correctly classify digits using a deep learning model.
